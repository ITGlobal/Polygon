// CQG Web API server protocol

package WebAPI_1;

// Last changes were made on 23 Dec 2015
// Version 1.32 - (version number is constructed as 'MAJOR.MINOR' from the following enums)
enum ProtocolVersionMajor
{
	// Major number change is required for backward incompatible protocol versions (new 'proto' file is necessary)
	PROTOCOL_VERSION_MAJOR = 1;
}
enum ProtocolVersionMinor
{
	// Minor number is increased for backward compatible protocol versions when new messages and/ or fields are
	// added without removing/ changing any existing messages and fields (new 'proto' file is not created)	
	PROTOCOL_VERSION_MINOR = 32;
}

// Protocol rules:
// 1)  CamelCase with an initial capital is used for message names while fields are lowercase underscore_separated_names
//     (see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style)
// 3)  Key numbers for existing fields must stay the same between minor protocol version changes.
// 4)  Negative values for enums and key numbers are prohibited.
// 5)  Only explicit signed (e.g. sint32) and unsigned (e.g. uint64) integer types must be used. Usage of implicit signed integer
//     types (e.g. int16) is prohibited since they are not supported by JS client library and consume a lot of space for 
//     negative values.
// 6)  Unsigned types should be used for fields that cannot have negative values. This allows to minimize their size.
// 7)  Field numbers < 16 takes one byte for a key/ wire-type header so numbers > 16 should be used for optional and infrequently used fields.
//     do not 'reserve' field numbers without real reasons.
//     See https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding for details.
// 8)  'Result' suffix is used in responses when only a single response is possible.
// 9)  'Status' suffix is used a separate message for a status of a subscription when subscriptions are not optional.
// 10) 'Report' suffix is used in responses when 'Result' and 'Data' are combined in a single message and when subscription is optional,
//     this allows to avoid two messages if subscription is not requested.
// 11) Time attributes are 64-bit signed integers that contain offset in milliseconds from base_time attribute of the logon and
//     session restore/join results.
// 12) Client implementation must be ready to get new values of any field associated with enum specified in this protocol
//     (all these fields are made uint32 to make protocol backward compatible for such changes). So when client gets unknown value it should
//     either ignore it or check whether it relates to failure (e.g. whether it's > 100 for StatusCode/ResultCode fields).


// Client to Server message, must include at least one field.
// Logon, LogonRoutineClient, RestoreOrJoinSession or ObtainDemoCredentials are required to be the first and the only message after connection.
// Client messages rate is limited, 1000 messages per 10 seconds by default.
// If this rate is exceeded then a user message is sent with details and the connection is closed.
// NOTE: This and other limits mentioned in this protocol are not guaranteed, they are given for reference only
// and are subject to change without prior notice.

//      meta-data for such contract is changed or expired. In case of expiration SymbolResolutionReport is returned with 'deleted' field set to True.
